#continue condition
#continue statement states that skip the current iteration of a loop and
#move to next iteration
#for example

for count in range(100):
    if count % 2 == 0:
        continue
    #if you see else is skipped because is built in function.
    #if we want we can use else statement, it makes same no difference
    #else:
    print(count)

# so this program states that it will skip the true condition and it will print false statement
#if you see this program print odd number
## pass - which is used in the statement, function, class and objects
# pass and continue -- same, it will skip the condition but pas is used in different ways
